Opinionated utility library

## Description

This project is supposed to be the base for all of my other work.  All of the
thought on safety, reusability and performance, once it has reached the
maturity, and stood the test of time, will end up here to be leveraged by all
of the projects.  This is also a place for experimentation so new ideas can
prove them selves in real-world scenarios.

This projects is still under heavy development, so I don't recommend using it
explicitly, but bits and pieces can be interesting to extract.
